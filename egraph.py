        An e-graph is composed of:

        - union_find: a Union-find structure that maps and e-class id to another e-class id,
                      whenever we add a new e-node that belongs to an existing e-class, 
                      it is initially assigned a new e-class id and merged to the existing e-class.
                      The newly created e-class id points to the original e-class for reference.

        - map_class: is a dictionary that maps an e-class id to the object e-class
        - hashcon: is a dictionary that maps an e-node to its e-class id
        - worklist, analysis: stores the e-nodes and e-classes that must be analysed for repair

        An e-node is a node where its children (if any) points
        to e-class id. Since every e-node inside an e-class is an
        equivalent expression, this creates multiple paths in the graph
        to write equivalent expressions departing from one e-node.

        Examples of e-node:
            Add(0, 1) - Add any node from e-class 0 to any node of e-class 1
            Log(0) - apply log to any e-node of e-class 0
            Const(1.0) - Just the constant value, 
                          without pointing to any e-class 

        Since during the update of the e-graph, some e-classes may be merged,
        we need to make sure the e-node childs point to the cannonical e-class.

        This is done by applying `find` to each child.
